## Forecasting Weekly Directional Movement of the S&P 500 Using Technical Indicators

### Project Overview
This project aims to forecast the weekly directional movement of the S&P 500 index using various technical indicators. The primary objective is to determine whether the closing price of the index will rise or fall over a week.

### Project To-Do List

#### 1. Literature Review
- Research existing methods for forecasting stock market movements.
- Review technical indicators commonly used in stock analysis.

#### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Clean the dataset (handle missing values, outliers, etc.).
- Calculate weekly returns based on closing prices.

#### Feature Engineering
- **Existing Indicators**: The dataset already includes relevant technical indicators such as:
  - Moving Averages (e.g., 5-day, 10-day)
  - Relative Strength Index (RSI)

- **Create Additional Features**:
  - **Golden Cross**: A bullish signal that occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average.
  - **Dead Cross**: A bearish signal that occurs when a shorter-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average.

#### 3. Define Target Variable
- Implement the logic to define the directional movement:
  - Assign `1` if `Close(t) > Close(t-5)`
  - Assign `0` otherwise.

#### 4. Model Selection
- Explore various forecasting models (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks).
- Determine the best model for your data.

#### 5. Model Training
- Split the data into training and testing sets.
- Train the selected models on the training set.

#### 6. Model Evaluation
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall).
- Use cross-validation to assess model stability.

#### 7. Results Analysis
- Analyze the results and interpret the modelâ€™s predictions.
- Visualize the forecasted vs. actual movements.

#### 8. Documentation
- Document the methodology, findings, and conclusions.
